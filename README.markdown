##Usage

##Limitations
This module has been primarily developed on CentOS v6. 
It has also been tested on Debian and Ubuntu, so should support most common Linux distributions. 

##Development
If you have any features that you feel are missing or find any bugs for this module, 
feel free to raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/fatmcgav/fatmcgav-glassfish/issues?state=open),
or even better submit a PR and I will review as soon as I can. 

##Testing
This module has been written to support Rspec testing of both the manifests and types/providers.
In order to execute the tests, run the following from the root of the module: 
 `bundle install && bundle exec rake spec`
